# Amazon-Fresh-Delivery-Slot-Notifier-COVID-19
The ***Amazon Fresh Delivery Slot Notification tool*** informs users when it finds a delivery slot open on the 'Amazon Fresh' checkout page.

In these uncertain times, it's essential that we do our part and stay home to stop the spread of COVD-19. Unfortunately, this also means that it's tough to get our hands on groceries. Amazon Fresh delivery slots are few and disappear within minutes due to extremely high demand. This application notifies users of available slots verbally and via push notifications to their phones.

We have tried to make this application user-friendly so that even non-technical users are able to run it on their systems in 3 easy steps:

1. Download the 'Push Me' app on your iPhone OR Windows PC and follow the in-app instructions to setup a token.
2. Create a text file called "user_notification.txt", paste your token (from Step-1) in this file. Save the file in the same folder as this application (Amazon_Delivery_Slot_Finder.exe).
3. Double-click the application to begin the process!.

Please share this with your friends and family!
