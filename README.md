In these uncertain times, it's essential that we do our part and stay home :house_with_garden: to stop the spread of COVID-19 :earth_asia:

Unfortunately, this also means that it's tough to get our hands on groceries. Amazon Fresh delivery slots are few and disappear within minutes due to extremely high demand.

The ***Amazon Fresh delivery slot notification tool*** informs users via system voice notifications üîàand push notifications :iphone: when it finds a delivery slot open on the 'Amazon Fresh' checkout page.

 

### We've tried to make this application user-friendly so that anyone is able to run it on their systems in 3 easy steps: 
**1.** Download the application -  
#### [Windows](https://github.com/ojasvi92/Amazon-Fresh-Delivery-Slot-Notifier-COVID-19/releases/download/v1.0.0-win32/Amazon_Delivery_Slot_Notifier.zip)
#### [MacOS](https://github.com/ojasvi92/Amazon-Fresh-Delivery-Slot-Notifier-COVID-19/releases/download/v1.0.0-macOS/Amazon_Delivery_Slot_Notifier.zip)

**2.** Download the 'PushMeAlert' app on your IOS/Android Phone and register with your phone number. Click on settings and copy tokens- user & key. (for more details refer to set-up instructions below)

**3.** Create a text file called "user_notification.txt", paste your tokens (from Step-2) in this file. Save the file in the same folder as the application. Double-click the application to begin the process!. (for more details refer to set-up instructions below)


### Please share this with your friends and family! #StrongerTogether :muscle:
