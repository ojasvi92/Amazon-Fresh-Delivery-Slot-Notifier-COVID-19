In these uncertain times, it's essential that we do our part and stay home :house_with_garden: to stop the spread of COVID-19 :earth_asia:

Unfortunately, this also means that it's tough to get our hands on groceries. Amazon Fresh delivery slots are few and disappear within minutes due to extremely high demand.

The ***Amazon Fresh delivery slot notification tool*** informs users verbally :speaker: and via push notifications :iphone: when it finds a delivery slot open on the 'Amazon Fresh' checkout page.

### We have tried to make this application user-friendly so that anyone is able to run it on their systems in **3 easy steps**:
**(Download the application from [here](https://github.com/ojasvi92/Amazon-Fresh-Delivery-Slot-Notifier-COVID-19/releases/download/v1.0.0/Amazon_Delivery_Slot_Notifier.zip) )**

**1.** Download the 'Push Me' app on your iPhone OR Windows PC and follow the in-app instructions to setup a token.

**2.** Create a text file called "user_notification.txt", paste your token (from Step-1) in this file. Save the file in the same folder as this application (Amazon_Delivery_Slot_Notifier.exe).

**3.** Double-click the application to begin the process!.

### Please share this with your friends and family! #StrongerTogether :muscle: 



### Pre-requisites ###
